## 2. Phenotype Token Structure

Building on the OBINexus base-4 genetic encoding:

```c
typedef struct {
    // Base-4 sensory state encoding
    unsigned int grip_pressure : 2;    // {0: none, 1: light, 2: medium, 3: hard}
    unsigned int reaction_speed : 2;   // {0: slow, 1: normal, 2: fast, 3: reflex}
    unsigned int steering_style : 2;   // {0: smooth, 1: gradual, 2: sharp, 3: erratic}
    unsigned int throttle_pattern : 4; // 16 throttle behavior patterns
    
    // Open axis extensions
    float axis_sensitivity[6];         // 6-axis sensitivity mapping
    float haptic_response_curve[4];    // Haptic feedback intensity
} SensoryPhenotype;
```

## 3. Dimensional Game Theory Integration

### 3.1 Scalar to Dimensional Promotion

Racing inputs undergo dimensional promotion when significance thresholds are exceeded:

```
Initial State: Steering = scalar value (-1.0 to 1.0)
Promoted State: Steering = {angle, velocity, acceleration, jerk}
```

**Activation Function**:
```
ϕ(steering_input) → D_steering if |Δsteering/Δt| > ε_velocity
```

### 3.2 Active Dimensions for Racing

```
D_racing = {
    D_steering,      // Wheel angle dynamics
    D_throttle,      // Acceleration patterns
    D_braking,       // Deceleration profiles
    D_drift,         // Lateral force management
    D_line_choice,   // Racing line optimization
    D_reaction       // Reflexive responses
}
```

## 4. Sensory Input Architecture

### 4.1 Multi-Modal Input Channels

```c
typedef struct {
    // Traditional inputs
    float steering_angle;
    float throttle_position;
    float brake_pressure;
    
    // Extended sensory inputs
    float grip_sensors[4];        // Pressure per finger
    float gyro_orientation[3];    // Controller tilt
    float proximity_sensors[2];   // Hand distance
    float skin_conductance;       // Stress/excitement
    float ambient_light;          // Environmental
    
    // Computed metrics
    float reaction_latency;
    float input_frequency;
    float consistency_score;
} SensoryInputFrame;
```

### 4.2 Open Axis Access Protocol

The system provides **6-axis simultaneous input** beyond traditional 2D controls:

1. **X-Axis**: Steering (primary)
2. **Y-Axis**: Throttle/Brake (primary)
3. **Z-Axis**: Vehicle height/jump (contextual)
4. **Roll**: Body roll compensation
5. **Pitch**: Weight transfer
6. **Yaw**: Drift angle control

## 5. Phenotype Evolution Algorithm

### 5.1 Player Pattern Recognition

```python
def evolve_phenotype(input_history, current_phenotype):
    # Analyze input patterns over time
    patterns = extract_patterns(input_history)
    
    # Compute evolution vector based on AS² methodology
    evolution_vector = compute_evolution(patterns, current_phenotype)
    
    # Apply controlled mutation (splicing, not splitting)
    new_phenotype = splice_phenotype(
        current_phenotype, 
        evolution_vector,
        constraint_set={
            'maintain_safety': True,
            'preserve_core_mappings': True,
            'gradual_adaptation': 0.1  # Max 10% change per session
        }
    )
    
    return new_phenotype
```

### 5.2 Adaptation Examples

**Scenario 1: Aggressive Driver**
- Detection: High steering velocity, late braking
- Evolution: Increase steering sensitivity, enhance brake response
- Haptic: Stronger force feedback for limit awareness

**Scenario 2: Smooth Driver**
- Detection: Gradual inputs, early braking
- Evolution: Expand fine control range, soften initial response
- Haptic: Subtle vibrations for track surface detail

## 6. Polyglot Console Integration

### 6.1 Universal Input Protocol

```c
typedef struct {
    uint32_t console_id;          // OBINexus console identifier
    uint8_t game_engine_type;     // Unity, Unreal, Custom
    SensoryPhenotype phenotype;   // Current evolved state
    
    // Polyglot translation layer
    void* (*translate_input)(SensoryInputFrame*, uint8_t engine);
    void (*apply_haptic)(HapticCommand*, uint8_t engine);
} PolyglotAdapter;
```

### 6.2 Cross-Platform Compatibility

## 7. Quantum Coherence for Predictive Input

Leveraging the Negatron-Positron framework for quantum-inspired predictive buffering:

```c
typedef struct {
    SensoryInputFrame future_buffer[QUANTUM_BUFFER_SIZE];
    float prediction_confidence;
    float coherence_factor;  // From Ψ-QFT framework
} QuantumInputPredictor;

// Predict player intent before action completes
PredictedAction predict_intent(SensoryInputFrame* current, 
                               QuantumInputPredictor* predictor) {
    // Use wavefunction coherence to anticipate next input
    return quantum_collapse_prediction(current, predictor);
}
```

## 11. Conclusion

The OBINexus Sensory Input Framework represents a paradigm shift in gaming peripherals, moving from static button mappings to dynamically evolving control schemes that adapt to each player's unique style. By integrating Dimensional Game Theory, AS² methodology, and quantum-inspired prediction, we create controllers that learn and grow with their users.

This polyglot architecture ensures compatibility across all major platforms while maintaining the sophisticated phenotype evolution that makes each controller uniquely suited to its owner. The result is not just a gamepad, but a personalized racing companion that enhances performance through deep understanding of player intent.
